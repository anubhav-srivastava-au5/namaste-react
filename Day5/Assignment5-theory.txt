                Chapter 05 - Assignment - Let's get Hooked!


1) What is the difference between Named export, default export and * as export?
A1) Named export -> we can directly export adding export keyword whenever we declare variable called as
Named export. we can use export in many component to export in 1 file.
Default export -> We can export component using export default and the component name so that it can be
imported and used in other files. we can export default only 1 component in 1 file.

In default import we dont use curly braces while in named import we use it.

Also , we can use both in 1 file export and default export.

* as is used so that we can import exported function as object. so that  we can use obj.title to import
and use. 

2) What is the importance of config.js file?
A2) config.js file or constant.js file is used to write all hard coded data used in application. so that
if we want to update anything we wont search each file.

3) What are React Hooks?
A3) React hooks are nothing but a normal function.

4) Why do we need a useState hook?
A4) We need useState hook to because if we use normal way of writing variables react cannot take count
of each variable and which is updating and when, hence it wont be able to render it.
If we use useState state variables react can take record of it and able to change if there is any change 
in the variable.
const a=10; //normal variable

const [searchKeyword,setSearchKeyword]=useState("kfc") //state variable via usestate. kfc is default value of search keyword.
