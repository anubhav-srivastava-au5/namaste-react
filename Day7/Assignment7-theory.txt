                Chapter 06 - Assignment - Finding the Path


1) What are various ways to add images into our App? Explain with code examples?
A1) We can add images through import which works when image is available in local directory, so that we 
can import in our project.

we can use cdn links or url of cloud storage in img tag.

2) What would happen if we do console.log(useState())?
A2) use state is a function.

Anything that starts with use in react is called as hook. hook is nothing but a function that gives 
superpower like useState gives us power to create dynamic variable that can change its data on web App
without loading the page.

3) How will useEffect behave if we don't add a dependency array?
A3) If we dont add dependency array in useEffect is will be call the callback function of useEffect 
everytime its renders the page.
there are other options too like keeping empty array which allows to callback function once while 
if we add anything in dependency array then it will be called everytime that variable is changed
like if we have added any useState variable in it so it will call callback function everytime it changes
the value of the variable.

4) What is SPA?
A4) SPA denotes single page application, what happens in old days is whenever we route to another page
we reload the page hence it call the api's on page etc. (it should not make any network call or load pages.)
but in react app it does not load any pages. 

5) What is difference between Client side routing and server side routing?
A5) Server side routing is old way of creating application. means need to load every page whenever we click.
But, Client side routing is new way of routing which means no need to load anything it is already loaded 
at once.
