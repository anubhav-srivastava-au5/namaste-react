d) Unit testing :-> core job of developer . each developer should perform it.
e) Integration testing :-> done by developer. Testing between 2 components.
f) Regression testing.
g) Smoke testing.
h) Performance testng.

2) What is Enzyme?
A2) Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and 
traverse your React Components' output. It was developed at Airbnb and later transferred to an independent 
organization.


3) Enzyme vs React Testing Library?
A3) Enzyme works best with class-based components.
React Testing Library will perform better in functional-based components. The official React documentation 
recommends using it whenever possible.

4) What is Jest and why do we use it?
A4) Jest is an open-source testing framework built on JavaScript, designed majorly to work with React and 
React Native-based web applications. Often, unit tests are not very useful when run on the front end of 
any software.

steps done for testing:->

installed react testig library -> npm i -D @testing-library/react
install jest -> npm i -D jest 
now run jest to configure -> npx jest --init -------> to create jest.config.js file once.
jest-environment-jsdom need to install dev dependency.

created first test case
configured babel for import syntax issue.
wrote expect sum
gitignore coverage folder
