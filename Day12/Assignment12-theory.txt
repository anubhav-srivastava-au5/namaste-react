1) What is prop drilling?
A1) Anyone who has worked in React would have faced this and if not then will face it definitely. 
Prop drilling is basically a situation when the same data is being sent at almost every level due to 
requirements in the final level. Here is a diagram to demonstrate it better. Data needed to be sent from 
Parent to childC. In this article different ways to do that are discussed.
In above example data sharing from parent to childA , childA to childB and then childB to childC is called
prop drilling, also data is unecessary present in childA and childB.

2) What is lifting the state up?
A2) Lifting the state up is the term given to when we need to give power to parent to dynamically handle
its children.

3) What is context provider and context consumer in react?
A3) context provider is used to pass the fetched data from the api and update the dummy context data.
while context consumer is used to do what useContext hook does for functional component, it basically 
get data from global context variable in the application for class based component.

4) If you don't pass a value to the provider does it take the default value?
A4) No, if we have used the provider to pass the value then it must pass the correct variables else it 
will give the error as undefined or parcel error if we didn't pass anything.
