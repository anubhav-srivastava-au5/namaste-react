                Chapter 12 - Assignment - Let's build our store


1) useContext vs Redux?
A1) useContext is a hook which allows to store data separately and can be accessed in any page. whereas,
redux is an object which stores data and can be accessed anywhere in our application.
FYI :-> We should implement redux only when there is large application for small application we should 
prefer context.

2) Advantage of using Redux toolkit over Redux?
A2) Redux toolkit is new and revised version over redux it is easier to implement than redux.

3) Explain Dispatcher?
A3) Dispatcher is an hook named useDispatch used for calling an action written inside store slice.

4) Explain Reducer?
A4) Reducer is default exported from slice which is combined called for all the reducers function written 
inside the slice.

5) Explain slice?
A5) slice is a sub section of store , basically slice is an key value pair of store and created separately 
where we right all actions and reducers of the component and can be called from there and connected inside 
store.

6) Explain selector?
A6) selector is used to fetch any data from the store. It basically calls the store slice and fetch data 
from the state of the slice store.

7) Explain createSlice and the configuration it takes?
A7) createSlice is used to create sub section in store. it takes name , initialState and reducers. where 
name is unique keyword defined to store slice , initialState is the global variables used in slice store to 
be accessed anywhere , and reducers are the function or actions needed to be performed inside this section.
